# Python Exercises: Array Manipulation and Transformation

Welcome to my Python exercises repository! This collection of exercises focuses on array manipulation and transformation using Python. Each exercise is designed to enhance your skills in handling arrays and performing fundamental operations.

## Exercise Overview

### 1. Creating and Manipulating Arrays

- **Create Array:** Generate an array using Python.
- **Check Dimensions:** Use a function to check the dimensions of the array.
- **Reshape Array:** Reshape the array to explore its structure.

### 2. Filtering and Analyzing Data

- **Non-Duplicated Data:** Create a function to obtain non-duplicated elements from the array.
- **Transform to List:** Convert the non-duplicated data back to a list.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Obtain the mean and quartiles for the non-duplicated data.

### 3. Matrix Operations

- **Add Unit to Each Element:** Add a unit to each element of the array.
- **Create Diagonal Matrix:** Generate a diagonal matrix based on the modified array.
- **Equally Divide:** Equally divide the diagonal matrix into `n` spaces.
